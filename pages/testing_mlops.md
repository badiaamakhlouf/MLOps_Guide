# Testing in MLOps


- Unit Tests in MLOps : 
    - Definition of unit tests and their importance in verifying the correctness of individual ML components.
    - Examples of unit tests in an ML pipeline:
      - Data preprocessing functions.
      - Feature extraction methods.
      - Model training functions.
    - Tools for unit testing: PyTest, unittest.
  - Integration Tests in MLOps: 
    - Definition of integration tests and their role in validating how different components of the pipeline interact.
    - Examples of integration tests:
      - Ensuring smooth data flow between preprocessing, training, and deployment stages.
      - Verifying the behavior of the full pipeline in an integrated environment.
    - Tools for integration testing: Testcontainers, Mocking services.
  - End-to-End Tests: 
    - Verifying the entire ML pipeline from data ingestion to model deployment.
    - Importance of testing the entire system to ensure reliability under real-world conditions.
    - Automation of these tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
