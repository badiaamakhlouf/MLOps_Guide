# Machine Learning Pipelines

## Overview 
- Definition of Machine Learning Pipelines
    - The concept of a pipeline in machine learning.
    - Stages of a typical ML pipeline (data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment).
  - Components of a Machine Learning Pipeline
    - Data ingestion and preprocessing.
    - Feature engineering and transformation.
    - Model selection and training.
    - Model evaluation and validation.
    - Deployment to production.
    - Monitoring and feedback loop.
   
A machine learning pipeline is a structured workflow that automates the process of transforming raw data into actionable insights. It typically consists of several stages: data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Key components of the pipeline include data ingestion and preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, evaluation and validation, deployment to production, and an ongoing feedback loop to ensure continuous improvement and monitoring.

## Stages of an ML Pipeline
 - Data Collection: 
    - Sources of data (structured, unstructured, real-time, batch).
    - Data pipelines and tools used (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow).
  - Data Preprocessing : 
    - Techniques for cleaning and transforming data.
    - Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
    - Feature extraction and selection.
  - Model Training: 
    - Types of models: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning.
    - Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
  - Model Evaluation: 
    - Common evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).
    - Cross-validation and model validation techniques.
  - Model Deployment: 
    - Ways to deploy ML models: APIs, containers (Docker), and serverless functions.
    - Tools for model deployment: MLflow, TensorFlow Serving, Kubeflow, etc.
  - Monitoring and Maintenance: 
    - Importance of monitoring model performance in production.
    - Retraining models, drift detection, and feedback loops.
    - Tools for monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
